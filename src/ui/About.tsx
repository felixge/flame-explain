      <p>
        In 2018 I found myself optimizing a lot of SQL queries using <a target="_new" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-explain.html">EXPLAIN ANALYZE</a> and wondered if <a target="_new" href="http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html">flame graph</a> visualizations might help to speed up this kind of work. I quickly build a proof of concept that converted the JSON output from PostgreSQL into the folded stack format expected by <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph">brendangregg/FlameGraph</a>. But unfortunately it didn't work for anything but trivial queries. As soon as CTEs or other Init Plans were present, the graphs would break due to child node times exceeding the total duration of their parents because PostgreSQL double counts node execution times under many circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that the project lingered in the back of my mind, and it wasn't until late 2019 that I had the time and inspiration that lead to a <PageLink page={QuirkCorrection} text="breakthrough" anchor="CTEs" /> in correcting the node times. However, once I looked at some more complicated queries again, it quickly became clear that flame graphs alone were not sufficient. They are great at highlighting the expensive parts of a query, but they fail to reveal the overall plan structure due to fast nodes getting effectively hidden by the visualization.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the time correction algorithms I came up with turned out to be useful beyond flame graphs, and no existing tool seemed to implement them. So I decided to build a unique tool that provides multiple visualizations based on these new algorithms and heuristics. The result is FlameExplain and I hope you find it useful : ).

      <Heading level={2}>Security & Privacy</Heading>
      <p>
        FlameExplain is a JavaScript application that runs in your browser and never sends your data to another computer. This should make it sufficiently secure for most use cases, including optimizing query plans that may contain confidential information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally FlameExplain is <a href="https://github.com/felixge/flame-explain">open source</a>, so you can study the code, create your own build, and run it on a machine without network access.
