## Code Formatting

This project uses prettier to keep code consistently formatted. To manually
reformat all code, you can run `yarn format`, but this will also be done via
CI if you forget.

However, it's recommended to integrate prettier with your editor for an optimal
editing experience. See https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html for more
information.
